## Meet Michael, software developer and mad scientist wannabe

Hey there, I'm Michael – a software developer by day and a mad scientist wannabe by night. In my free time, I love tinkering with all kinds of tech, testing out new ideas, and seeing what's possible.

You can check out my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/myarichuk) to see some of the things I'm working on. I love experimenting with various algorithms or try out new libraries. This applies to frameworks, obscure or low-level Operating Syste  APIs - I like them all! I'm always eager to tackle new challenges, no matter how complex, obscure, or cutting-edge.

You might be wondering why you haven't heard of me before. Well, I used to be what some, like Scott Hanselman in [his blog post](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dark-matter-developers-the-unseen-99), call a "dark matter developer". I was simply staying out of anything public and just doing my thing. But I've had a change of heart and decided to share what I've learned – whether that's new and exciting things I've done, bugs I've found, or gotchas I've encountered. I'm here to learn, grow, and contribute to the tech community, so feel free to share your feedback or ideas with me!

That's why I started this blog and started speaking at conferences. I'm not just doing it for the fame and glory (although that's a nice bonus). I want to help other devs to improve their skills, knowledge and if I inspire someone to create cool stuff, that would be amazing :)

If you have any feedback on my anything I wrote, my past talks or projects, I'd love to hear it. I'm always looking for feedback, new ideas or ways to improve.
