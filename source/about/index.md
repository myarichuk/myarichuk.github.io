Hey there, I'm Michael - part software engineer, part mad scientist, and 100% unapologetic tech enthusiast. Whether I'm tinkering with algorithms or testing out new libraries, I'm always pushing the limits and seeing what's possible.

You might be thinking, "Who is this guy and why haven't I heard of him before?" Well, let's just say I used to be what some people call a ["dark matter developer"](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dark-matter-developers-the-unseen-99) - you know, lurking in the shadows, doing my thing without anyone knowing about it. But I'm done hiding, and I'm ready to share what I've learned with the world.

So here I am, blogging and speaking at conferences, not just for the fame and glory (although that's a nice bonus), but because I want to inspire other devs to create cool stuff and push the boundaries of what's possible.

Check out my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/myarichuk) if you want to see some of the things I've been working. From low-level Operating System APIs to obscure libraries and new frameworks, I'm not afraid to tackle any challenge that comes my way.

That's why I started this blog and started speaking at conferences. I'm not just doing it for the fame and glory (although that's a nice bonus). I want to help other devs to improve their skills, knowledge and if I inspire someone to create cool stuff, that would be amazing :)

I'm always looking for feedback, new ideas, or ways to improve, so don't be shy. If you've got something to say, hit me up and let's chat. Who knows, we might just change the tech world together.
