## The What and the Why

In the tech world, 'production-ready' is a phrase that gets tossed around a lot—sometimes more like a hot potato than a clear standard. It seems like everyone has their own take, often shrouded in personal biases or cloaked in industry jargon. In this post, we're cutting through the fluff and the corporate mumbo-jumbo. We're diving deep into what 'production-ready' really means for software. From the crucial importance of structured logging to the non-negotiable need for comprehensive testing, we'll explore the essentials that separate a robust, reliable product from a ticking time bomb waiting to implode in the production environment.

## Non-negotiable 1: Structured Logging and Monitoring – The Unsung Heroes of Software

"Ugh, okay. I'll add some logging here and here." Sound familiar? I've heard it before. If you've heard this from a fellow developer or, dare I say, caught yourself thinking it, it's time for a perspective shift. Structured logging and monitoring are far more than a tedious chore or a review checklist item. They're the unsung heroes of the software world, often overlooked in favor of the latest AI features or eye-catching UI elements.
Yet, it's these behind-the-scenes players that keep your software ship sailing smoothly in the stormy seas of production. They're not just about producing lines of text for an eventual, maybe-never glance. It's about weaving a coherent narrative of your application’s life in the wild, providing clarity amidst chaos. And trust me, when things go south at 2 AM, you'll wish for logs that read like a detective novel, not a cryptic puzzle.

But it's not just about logging. Monitoring is your lookout on the crow's nest, giving you a heads-up before you hit an iceberg. It’s about knowing the difference between a one-off glitch and a symptom of a deeper malady. Without effective monitoring, you're essentially flying blind, hoping for the best but not really prepared for the worst. Minimum monitoring, should include historical data of important system metrics, such as disk and memory usage, but also of vital application internals like cache sizes, internal queue length and so on. In case of a production instance going foobar at 2am, such historical data can and will help you deduce what has made your system crash.

Now, let's pause for a sec and clear up a common mix-up (and I am guilty of mixing it up too in the past!): *monitoring* and *performance metrics*. They're both crucial, but comparing them is like comparing apples with oranges.

*Monitoring* is your software's constant health check. It's about keeping tabs on the vitals — stuff like disk usage, memory usage, cache sizes, and queue lengths. Think of it as the dashboard in your car. It doesn't just tell you if you're about to run out of gas (or crash), but it also gives you a heads-up on the overall health of your system. It's there to make sure your software doesn't go off the rails without any warning.

Then there's *performance metrics*. This is about measuring your software's muscle power. How quick is it in handling requests? Does it crumble under heavy user traffic or does it stand strong? Performance metrics are your deep-dive into how efficiently your software performs under different scenarios. It's like having a detailed report card that tells you exactly which areas need improvement for your software to perform at its best.

In essence, while monitoring is your day-to-day, ongoing health check, performance metrics are your strategic deep dive into performance optimization. They're both essential, but they serve different purposes in the realm of production-ready software. And understanding this is what helps you make smart, informed decisions about your software’s health and performance.

Next, let's discuss *performance metrics*, because why not?

## Non-negotiable 2: Performance Metrics
TODO:
- Dive into why detailed performance metrics matter.
- Emphasize on post-mortem analysis capabilities.

## Non-negotiable 3: Memory Dump Facilities
TODO:
- Explain dump role in diagnosing catastrophic failures.
- Do some tips or best practices. link to my blog about memory dumps?

## Non-negotiable 4: Comprehensive App Testing
TODO:
- Discuss different types of testing (unit, functional, integration) and their relevance.
- Emphasize on the need for meaningful tests, not just high coverage numbers.
