# Blog
My humble blog that uses the awesome [Hexo.io](https://github.com/myarichuk/Blog) to generate a static website (this is a "before compilation" version, as Hexo "compiles" blog posts written in markdown to create static-html website)

If you see any errors/inconsistencies/typos in my posts, or you want to provide some feedback about stuff I write, you are more than welcome to let me know and perhaps even do a PR :)
