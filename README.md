# Blog
My humble blog that uses Hexo.io to generate a static website (this is a "before compilation" version, as Hexo "compiles" blog posts written in markdown to create static-html website)

If you see any errors/inconsistencies/typos in my posts, you are welcome to let me know and perhaps even do a PR :)
